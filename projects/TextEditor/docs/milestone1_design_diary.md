        Working on Milestone 1
Get a basic border around the whole gui with a nice color
Have tabs for several options that can be chosen such as file, edit, options, etc.
    Create a function printing the tabs onto the gui to make the main more clean
        Figure out the parameters it needs and what it is returning( if any (which it is not))
        Figure out how to actually make that work
Working on Milestone 2
    Working on outputting from file
So char is not allowed to be in in mvwprintw since it is not a constant
In the else to check if it is open add a function that will return an error for what the problem is
        Have a function that takes in the name of the issue and creates a panel to output on
        Too difficult to include to panel right now will get back to it but will still create an       
        error function for an easier job in the future
