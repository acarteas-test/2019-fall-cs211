    Working on outputting from file
So char is not allowed to be in in mvwprintw since it is not a constant
In the else to check if it is open add a function that will return an error for what the problem is
        Have a function that takes in the name of the issue and creates a panel to output             on
        Too difficult to include to panel right now will get back to it but will still create an         error function for an easier job in the future
Tried modifying print tabs so that it uses a vector but it proved to be too hard
Instead Iâ€™m using a vector to hold all the chars from a file and then output them on the screen with a word wrap
I can now output to the screen but with two issues
        The spaces are missing
        Word wrap is not working
            Could actually have word wrap as a function instead of being in main
Word Wrap Pseudo code
    Takes in vector and window and returns nothing
        But it prints the words in the borders of the window
Thanks to Mr. Carter I was able to fix the problem of not outputting spaces
Was able to get word wrap working but it is not in a function of itself yet
Vertical Scrolling(in the future)
    For now it takes in a char and prints the next line of text
