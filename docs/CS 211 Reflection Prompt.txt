Reflection Prompt
        I’ve had several issues while trying to create the graphic user interface, one of the worst being creating a function that would print the tabs at the top of the gui. Adding the color was the easiest part of the function. It was just making sure that the colors are supported and then turned on. Then it was just selecting colors I wanted to use and naming it to a variable that would subsequently be turned on. The biggest issue was figuring out how to insert all the tab names into the function without having to call the function multiple times. What I would recommend future students to do is to actually use more functions. Now thinking back I could try to make a function for color so that the main file looks a lot cleaner and easier to understand. What I had the most fun with was surprisingly creating the tabs function. In the moment it was a bit challenging figuring out how to get it to work, but once it was finished, I was so happy. I was able to see it actually print the name of the tabs for the screen. I just hope that this will not hinder me in the future when I need to create panels for each tab. I actually wanted to create a panel in the middle of the screen that would ask if the user is sure that they would like to close the window, but I haven’t fully understood how to implement it just yet. I felt this assignment was pretty good so I have no real clue how to improve it in the future. It was a challenging assignment, but wasn’t too hard to the point that I wanted to give up. What was the hardest part of this assignment to understand is what curses functions to use when and where. This was my first time ever seeing and using pdcurses so I was really confused in the beginning. Luckily, there were several sites I could open that would explain to me the different function and how to properly use them.
